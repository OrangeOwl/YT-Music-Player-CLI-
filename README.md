# YT Music Player -CLI (Command-Line Interface)-
A Youtube Music Player for playing songs over command-line written in Python
* NOTE: I know the code isn't very good, please make suggestions if you have any!

## Required Applications
* VLC
* Python 3

## Required Python Libraries
* vlc
* pafy
* mechanize

## A very simple and bare-bones CLI player for VLC
* The goal of this project was to make a simple VLC-based CLI player that can cycle through my youtube music playlist without requiring downloading the video (which takes up unnecessary bandwidth) and without playing ads

## Commands/How to Run
* First gather a bunch of youtube urls and add them to the .m3u file (with a url on each line)
* Then to run the script, type: 'python3 YTS.py' in your command line/terminal
