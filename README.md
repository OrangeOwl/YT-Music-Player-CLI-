# YT-Music-Player-CLI-
A Youtube Music Player for playing songs over command-line written in Python

## Required Python Libraries
* vlc
* pafy
* mechanize

## A very simple and bare-bones CLI player for VLC
* The goal of this project was to make a simple VLC-based CLI player that can cycle through my youtube music playlist without requiring downloading the video (which takes up unnecessary bandwidth) and without playing ads

## COMMANDS
* to run the script, type: 'python3 YTS.py' in your command line
* Once running, there are two available commands: STOP and NEXT (which are pretty self explanatory)
